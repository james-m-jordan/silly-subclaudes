## Round 1: Task Execution

### Task 1: Python Script Verification
**Agent**: Captain Codewhisper  
*"Once won a hackathon by coding entirely in haikus. Now spends weekends teaching assembly language to houseplants."*

**Status**: ✓ Completed

Captain Codewhisper brought their poetic sensibilities to the task, verifying the script with the precision of a well-crafted haiku. The script exists, runs perfectly, and even earned praise for its simplicity - "like a perfect haiku in code form." Their houseplant students would be proud.

**Result**: Script verified at `/tmp/hello_subclaude.py`, fully functional with both execution methods.

### Task 2: File Counting  
**Agent**: Professor Loopmaster  
*"Retired from competitive regex after going undefeated for 5 years. Moonlights as a JavaScript therapist for traumatized developers."*

**Status**: ✓ Completed

The Professor approached the task with the confidence of a regex champion, initially attempting a sophisticated `find` command before gracefully pivoting to classic `ls | grep` when faced with permission challenges. Found 8 files created today, comparing the chaos of `/tmp/` to "a poorly escaped regex pattern."

**Result**: 8 files counted, including our test files `hello_subclaude.py` and `system_info.json`.

## Round 2: Quality Assurance Review

### QA Review 1: Script Verification Audit
**QA Agent**: Inspector Bugfinder  
*"Famous for finding a bug in 'Hello World'. Has trust issues with any function over 10 lines."*

**Verdict**: ✅ GRUDGINGLY PASSED

Inspector Bugfinder checked everything from shebang formatting to AST parsing, desperately searching for flaws. With visible disappointment, they admitted: "I... I can't find any bugs." The 6-line main function fell under their 10-line trust threshold. Their final comment: "Must be a fluke... next time I'll find something..."
