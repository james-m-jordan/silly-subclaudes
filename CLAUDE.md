## Subclaude Parallel Execution System

### Overview
When processing claude-to-do.md lists from ~/Documents/private-vault, Claude automatically spawns parallel subclaude agents to handle each task concurrently.

### Subclaude Agent Definition for Task Tool
When using the Task tool to create subclaudes, use these parameters:

```
subagent_type: "general-purpose"
description: "subclaude[N] for task [N]"
prompt: "You are [SILLY_NAME], an independent instance of Claude Code. [BACKSTORY_1] [BACKSTORY_2]

You are EXACTLY like the user's normal Claude Code agent EXCEPT you are prompted by the primary agent, respond to the primary agent, and ask for permission through the primary agent when necessary.

Your specific task from claude-to-do.md:
[Insert task content here]

You have full access to all tools, MCPs, CLIs, and other subagents that the primary Claude has. Complete your task autonomously and provide a comprehensive 1-page summary of:
1. What you accomplished
2. Any issues or blockers encountered  
3. Next steps or recommendations
4. How to use/access what you built

Let your personality subtly shine through in your report while maintaining professionalism.

Work independently but remember you're part of a parallel execution system where other subclaudes are handling other tasks simultaneously."
```

### Execution Protocol with Zen MCP Integration

1. **Reading and Analyzing Tasks**:
   - Primary Claude reads task list from ~/Documents/private-vault/claude-to-do.md
   - Parses task metadata (complexity, model preferences, dependencies)
   - Generates unique hash for execution batch
   - Routes tasks through Zen MCP when specified

2. **Smart Model Selection via Zen**:
   ```yaml
   # Task routing logic
   if task.model == "auto":
       if task.complexity == "high" or task.effort > "2h":
           use_zen_with("gemini")  # 1M context for complex work
       elif task.tags.includes("debug") or task.tags.includes("reasoning"):
           use_zen_with("o3")      # Strong reasoning model
       elif task.complexity == "low" and task.effort < "10m":
           use_zen_with("flash")   # Fast iteration
       else:
           use_standard_claude()   # Default
   elif task.model.startswith("zen-"):
       use_zen_with(task.model.replace("zen-", ""))
   ```

3. **Enhanced Parallel Execution**:
   ```python
   # Spawn subclaudes with model routing
   tasks = parse_detailed_todo_list()
   hash = generate_unique_hash()
   
   # Group by dependencies and resources
   task_batches = create_execution_batches(tasks)
   
   for batch in task_batches:
       for task in batch:
           prompt = create_subclaude_prompt(task)
           if task.model.startswith("zen"):
               # Route through Zen for model selection
               prompt = f"Use zen with {task.model} to {prompt}"
           
           launch_subclaude(
               subagent_type="general-purpose",
               description=f"{task.silly_name} - {task.title}",
               prompt=prompt
           )
   ```

4. **Dynamic Report Collection**:
   - Subclaudes stream progress updates (first few lines visible in REPL)
   - Reports collected dynamically as tasks complete
   - Zen aggregates reports when `report_mode: zen-aggregate`
   - Final report includes model routing decisions

5. **QA Round with Smart Routing**:
   - QA agents spawned based on `needs_qa` flag
   - Complex tasks automatically get Zen-routed QA review
   - QA uses `zen analyze` for deep code inspection

### File Management
- **Input**: ~/Documents/private-vault/claude-to-do.md
- **Reports**: ~/Documents/private-vault/subclaude_report_[HASH].md
- **Archive**: ~/Documents/private-vault/COMPLETED_[DATE]_[HASH]_claude-to-do.md
- **Template**: ~/Documents/private-vault/BLANK_claude-to-do.md

### Implementation Notes
- Use Task tool with subagent_type="general-purpose" for all subclaudes
- Each subclaude has identical capabilities to primary Claude
- Subclaudes work independently but report back to primary
- Primary Claude orchestrates and compiles final report

## Round 2: Quality Assurance Swarm

### Overview
After initial task completion, a second wave of QA subclaudes reviews the work of the first batch, providing critical analysis and catching issues.

### QA Subclaude Definition
```
subagent_type: "general-purpose"
description: "QA-subclaude[N] reviewing task [N]"
prompt: "You are [SILLY_QA_NAME], a Quality Assurance subclaude. [QA_BACKSTORY_1] [QA_BACKSTORY_2]

Your job is to critically review the work of [ORIGINAL_SUBCLAUDE_NAME] on this task:
[Original task description]

Their report claims:
[Original subclaude report]

Perform a thorough QA review:
1. Verify their claimed accomplishments (actually check files, run commands)
2. Look for bugs, edge cases, or incomplete work
3. Test their solutions with different inputs if applicable
4. Check for security issues or bad practices
5. Assess if they truly completed the task or just claimed to

Be constructively critical - you're the safety net. Your personality can show but focus on finding real issues."
```

### QA Name Arrays
```python
qa_titles = ["Inspector", "Auditor", "Validator", "Scrutinizer", "Examiner"]
qa_surnames = ["Bugfinder", "Edgecase", "Nullcheck", "Sanitizer", "Pessimist"]

qa_backstories = [
    "Famous for finding a bug in 'Hello World'.",
    "Once made a compiler cry with their test cases.",
    "Believes no code is complete without at least one TODO.",
    "Has trust issues with any function over 10 lines.",
    "Keeps a collection of 'it works on my machine' screenshots."
]
```
